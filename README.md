I am a Computer Science student at Federal University of Parana (UFPR) in Curitiba, Brazil. I was born and raised in Sao Paulo and moved cities in 2024 for college. I am currently on my third semester and I code mainly using C.

I am really passionate about programming, math, sports, reading and games. I look forward to becoming an outstanding programmer and I really hope being able to use my knowledge to help others. Here you will find some more information about my projects.
